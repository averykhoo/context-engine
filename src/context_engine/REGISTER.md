# Residual-risk register

Residual risks (FRAMEWORK P17, §7.4): each is a risk that was not reasonably practicable to
eliminate, with whom it affects, why it stays, the control that holds it and where it came from.
`task close` appends the residuals of a task's `## Design review`; edit an entry only when the
code changes. Ids are `INV-n`, never reused.

This is the engine's own register. It is package data, so it ships with the engine to every repo
the engine is pointed at: `context-engine register show --engine` reads it there, and `orient`
points at it (the handover, P17 regs. 7 and 11). A target repo keeps its own register for its own
risks (FRAMEWORK §10: `docs/invariants.md`).
